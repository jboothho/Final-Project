# Environmental Health Mapping Tool using C++, Python, and ArcGIS Pro 
Final Project for CS2300 by Julia Booth-Howe*

## Project Summary
This project takes in datasets through C++ where it sorts and performs basic statistical analyses that are passed to Python. The Python script is connected with the arcGIS API and will be used to create maps showing the data. 

## Description of Concepts Used and Which Modules they came from
- Class: header and .cpp files: Module 1
- Overloaded operators: Module 1
- File input/ output: Module 2
- Multiple Languages: Module 3
- Command Line Interface: Module 3

## Operating System
- MacOS
## Necessary Installations
- ArcGIS Python API
- Jupyter Notebook

## Grade based on the Rubric:

While I veered from the grading rubric a little bit, I believe that I deserve close to full credit on this assignment. The C++ part is fully functioning and I was able to manipulate the data to create a new csv file with shared characteristics from each to send to the jupyter notebook. I also put a whole lot of hours into trying to learn the arcGIS API for Python and am just a step away from having this in full functionality.
